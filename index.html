          <h3>Julibee is me!</h3>
          <p>My name is Julianna Beckert. Sometimes Julie B., sometimes J.B. I enjoy developing a mutually respectful working relationship with my client-friends. I’ll treat you good. What I offer is a collaboration, addressing what you need and want with my broad array of skills and experience.</p>
          <p>I look forward to Mondays, because I like my work. It’s fun and challenging. I get to meet new people all the time and find out what they’re like to work with. We have meaningful conversations about what they do and what they aspire for. We crush deadlines. We present work that we’re proud of.</p>
          <p>Weird and wacky are my favorite qualities in life and in my work. My style trends towards a wackadoodle minimalism. I strongly believe in less-is-more, but love to flood the eyes with chaos when it’s called for.</p>
          <p>Give me a ring-a-ling if you want my ding-a-ling.</p>
