			<p>A well established roofing company in my hometown, Tulsa, Oklahoma was doing great business, but needed a little update on their site. A Savvy relative built their original site. They put EVERYTHING in there, utilizing ALL the bells and whistles. My computer fan would start running immediately when loading the site.  There was no lack of content on this one, but it was a big mess. I got to carefully dig through the pile and reorganize the content. It was a Marie Kondo level satisfying joy to clean up.  The end result was a more logical, and usable flow of information. Less distraction gives more attention to the content. Content is king after all.</p>
