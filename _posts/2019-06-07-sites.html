			<p>Web design is fun because there are a lot of factors to consider. Brand, intention, user interaction, and how it will be built. The tone communicated the appropriate vibe. There is appropriate organization of all the information, to make it easy for users to find the information they need, where theyâ€™d expect to find it. It requires an awareness of user interface patterns, and also the nitty gritty behind the scenes. I write mark-up. I get really geeky and excited when I get to write code. Understanding how elements of a site physically come together is completely necessary. Anything is possible, but some things will require more development time, and blow the budget. </p>
