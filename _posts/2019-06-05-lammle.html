			<p>To tell you the truth, I don’t exactly understand what it is that Todd does. I suspect I’d have to take one of his classes to really get it. Cyber security. What I do know is that he IS his product. His knowledge, his books, and his classes. He already had a set of color he liked, and he wanted his logo to be real straight-forward. Clean and simple. With a small budget and a short timeline, we were able to walk away with a pretty professional look.</p>
