			<p>To be honest, I don’t exactly understand what it is that Todd does. I suspect I’d have to take one of his classes to really get it. Cybersecurity, am I right? What I do know is that Todd Lammle is his own product. He offers his knowledge, his books, and classes. He already had a set of colors he liked, and he wanted his logo to be really straightforward. Clean and simple. With a small budget and a short timeline, we were able to walk away with a professional look.</p>
