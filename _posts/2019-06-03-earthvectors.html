			<h1> {{page.project_title}} </h1>
			<p>A group of extremely talented engineers came together to create a boutique development shop. They had a logo that represented the earth with a vector shooting off. I revamped the logo a bit to incorporate the tree of life to represent the convergence of knowledge. I gave the whole thing a wash of 90â€™s futuristic technology, with a modern color palette. </p>
