<h3>The Challenge:</h3>

<p>Sexy Pizza is turning 10 years old! They needed a t-shirt design for their employees and an ad to match.</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>

<p>I pitched a few ideas for the subject of this t-shirt. "Lady passionately kissing pizza" won. I adopted the Sexy Pizza logo style and drew inspiration from 50's comic illustrations. I drew this in Illustrator, giving me the ability to fine tune the outlines to create a natural look.</p>
