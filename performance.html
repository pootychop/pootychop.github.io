      <p>I’m Julianna. I am a warm-hearted and enthusiastic contributor to team dynamics. I first caught the performance bug at art school (Kansas City Art Institute). I majored in Sculpture and focused on installation art. My final art project included motors and cams that made foam-filled pantyhose dance to a soundtrack of big-band/latin music.</p>
      <p>Some other sculpture majors and I founded a performance art cheerleading squad with a lasting legacy — Rah-Booty! We made our own costumes, wrote and performed cheers about femininity, politics, social norms, and UTIs. We eventually started creating music as well. I collected toy instruments and soldered in jacks so we could plug them in for shows and recordings. </p>

      <p>I’ve collaborated on a whole bunch of musical projects over the years, been in bands, did a couple large-scale art performances, danced in a couple different music videos and even went on tour with Ssion as a dancer. More recently I’ve been doing tons of improv. One of my improv teams does musicals.</p>
